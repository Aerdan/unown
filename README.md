Unown
-----
Unown is a script for generating an EPUB 3.0 Container from a set of
files. It includes support for whitelists and blacklists.

Usage
-----
`unown.py config.toml book.epub`

Configuration
-------------
The following is a minimalistic configuration for Unown, with comments.

```toml
title="An Example"
#subtitle="..."
language="en-US"
# Not actually used, but should be the copyright year.
copyright=2018
creator="John Doe"
contributors=[ "Jane Doe" ]
# Where we should look for your files.
directory="example"
# This setting will cause Unown to generate a 'complete' package even
# if whitelists or blacklists are specified.
generate_all=true
# The uuid is generated by Unown and should be left intact if present,
# unless you're copying an old configuration, in which case it should
# be removed. 
#uuid = "..."

# Whitelists are presumed to consist only of viewable documents under
# the OEBPS subdirectory of the directory configured above. Other
# files (CSS, etc.) should be in the configured directory.
#
# Whitelist UUIDs are used in lieu of the primary UUID for whitelist-
# based EPUB generation.
#[whitelist]
#story=[ 'foo.html', 'bar.html' ]
#story_uuid = "..."

# Blacklists exclude only files in the OEBPS subdirectory of the
# directory configured above. Other files in the configured directory
# are included regardless.
#[blacklist]
#choice=[ 'baz.html' ]
#choice_uuid = "..."
```

Templates
---------
Unown includes a set of Jinja2 templates in the `templates/` directory.
The following is a list of templates for Unown.

* `container.xml` -- Not actually a template, but it's part of the EPUB
  3.0 Container specification, and it points to the `.opf` file.
* `nav.html` -- Used to generate the table of contents for navigation.
* `package.xml` -- Used to generate the EPUB 3.0 Package Document for
  the ebook. This file is specified in `container.xml`.

Contributions
-------------
There are two scripts included with Unown which may be of interest.
`extract_4chan.py` extracts all posts from a 4chan thread into the
specified target directory. The second takes a directory of such posts
and merges them in to a single file. It uses the id of the first post
in the thread to name the resulting file.

These scripts include their own Jinja2 templates, which are documented
below:

* `post.html` -- Used by `extract_4chan.py` to render individual posts.
* `thread.html` -- Used by `merge_4chan.py` to render the whole thread.
* `thread_post.html` -- Used by `merge_4chan.py` to render posts in the
  thread.

Additional scripts may be incorporated for other purposes.
