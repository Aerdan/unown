Configuration
-------------
The following is a minimalistic configuration for Unown, with comments.

```toml
title="An Example"
#subtitle="..."
language="en-US"
# Not actually used, but should be the copyright year.
copyright=2018
creator="John Doe"
contributors=[ "Jane Doe" ]
# Where we should look for your files.
directory="example"
# This setting will cause Unown to generate a 'complete' package even
# if whitelists or blacklists are specified.
generate_all=true
# The uuid is generated by Unown and should be left intact if present,
# unless you're copying an old configuration, in which case it should
# be removed. 
#uuid = "..."

# Whitelists are presumed to consist only of viewable documents under
# the OEBPS subdirectory of the directory configured above. Other
# files (CSS, etc.) should be in the configured directory.
#
# Whitelist UUIDs are used in lieu of the primary UUID for whitelist-
# based EPUB generation.
#[whitelist]
#story=[ 'foo.html', 'bar.html' ]
#story_uuid = "..."

# Blacklists exclude only files in the OEBPS subdirectory of the
# directory configured above. Other files in the configured directory
# are included regardless.
```
